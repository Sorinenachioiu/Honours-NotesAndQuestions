# Meeting Minutes - 14 Dec 2023

## Reports

### Things to remember
- First block in a blockchain system = ***genesis block***
- Blockchain = ***immutable append-only log*** 
    - immutable thanks to the hashes(merkle root and hash of previous block) => infeasible to change it, if the adversaries have > 50% of the system => nothing can be done to stop they. 
    - append-only - you can only add blocks at the end of the blockchain
    - log - the ledger is a way to log transactions, be it financial or data transfers.

### Clarification about the system
- Hospitals are considered to ahve some ICT's that can run the querries.
- The queries can have any lenght and be sent in the block.

### While talking about papers read
- Remember the ***author name*** of the paper, at least a few.
- Try not to say what is said in the paper and what really happens in it.

### Extra
- Because Sorin does not have enough computational power on his laptop he might get access to some servers to run the program on.
